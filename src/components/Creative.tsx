                    I‚Äôm interested in capturing moody, atmospheric moments that speak louder than words.
                    Through my lens, I explore the delicate dance between light and shadow, where every frame becomes a quiet story waiting to be felt.

                    I‚Äôm drawn to scenes that evoke emotion‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs the stillness of a foggy morning, the glow of golden hour, or the raw intensity in a fleeting expression.
                    My photography isn‚Äôt just about what you see, but about what you feel‚Äîinviting viewers to pause, reflect, and connect with the soul of the moment.

                    Together with a group of passionate friends, I co-created a short film titled <em>Nizhal</em>, which we proudly released on YouTube.
                    This creative journey went far beyond just filming‚Äîit helped me grow as a storyteller, leader, and designer.
